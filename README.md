## Instructions

This is a course project for the Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree. It is an interactive memory board game.

- index.html holds the HTML for the memory game.
- css/app.cs holds the css style code
- css/animation.css holds the css styling for animations (not currently implemented, but planned for future versions!)
- img holds the image files for the game
- js/app.js holds the js code for the interactivity

## Contributing

I made built myself (on top of some starter code from Udacity), but feel free to make your own version. You can contact me at aftoncoombs@gmail.com
